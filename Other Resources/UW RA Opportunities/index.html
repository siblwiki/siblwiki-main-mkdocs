<h1>UW RA Opportunities</h1>
<p>The University of Washington offers a variety of opportunities for its students who are interested in research. You as a research assistant may decide that you would like to conduct an independent study of some sort or maybe even apply to grad school but do not know how to get the funds to do so. There are a variety of programs that exist on UW’s campus to engage students in research across disciplines. In this Chapter of the handbook you will learn about what the UW has to offer you to advance your research experiences and aid you in your journey in the discipline of psychology.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="educational-opportunity-program-eop">Educational Opportunity Program (EOP)<a class="headerlink" href="#educational-opportunity-program-eop" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The educational opportunity Program is a program within the Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity here at the UW. It promotes academic success and graduation for underrepresented minorities (i.e. Native American, Latino, Pacific Islander, African American, etc.), economically disadvantaged, and first generation college students. The Academic counselors of this program promote are generalists, trained to help students to explore possible majors and career goals. The EOP team also assists students with financial aid, housing, personal matters, and a host of additional supportive services.</p>
<p><strong>How to become an EOP student</strong></p>
<p>There are two way students can be a part of EOP. The first is a contract that one signs when they accept their offer to the UW. This is returned with the acceptance confirmation from the UW. To become an EOP student after one comes to the UW the student must see an EOP advisor at Mary Gates Hall Suite 141. Here the advisors can walk students through the general application process. In order to be a part EOP one must be a current UW student and fulfill one of the requirements listed in the description above.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits for EOP Scholars</strong></p>
<p>The EOP Advising/Counseling Center offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A developmental model of academic advising that acknowledges and supports the different educational tasks that students encounter during their university experience</li>
<li>A holistic emphasis upon the education of the whole person including the development of skills that support success in academic tasks and in life through curricular and co-curricular engagement</li>
<li>A recognition that students are members of many communities including family, neighborhood, and social organizations as well as the University of Washington</li>
<li>An ethnically diverse staff of professional advisers and support personnel committed to providing accurate information about university procedures and policies</li>
<li>Access to a wide range of support services such as enrollment service, personalized academic and career advising, financial aid and housing resources, peer mentoring, internships and leadership/volunteer resources, and referrals to other Office of Minority Affairs and University of Washington programs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="independent-studies">Independent Studies<a class="headerlink" href="#independent-studies" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Independent studies are a great way to get to know researchers in the lab and to grow skills that you can potentially use in the workforce and in graduate or professional school. In order to do an independent study in this lab researchers should complete the minimum 2 quarter requirement as a Research Assistant (RA). To start an independent project, you must discuss your research interests with a grad student or the Principle Investigator (i.e. Sapna). It is key to determining where within your interests you can expand upon psychological knowledge. Once you have taken this step arrange to meet with the PI to discuss your independent project. If the PI sees that your interests align with what the lab is studying, and what our funding can cover, you will be either asked to brainstorm some ideas based on psychological literature or explore one of several topics assigned to you by the PI. They will most likely ask you to think about where there are “holes in the research” You will need to do three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explore what the research has yet to find out about a particular topic. This can be done by looking at the future directions section of the paper, and reading other articles cited within the paper or that use similar keywords.</li>
<li>Once you have completed your preliminary research, you will then come up with some sort of study design, and think about your general hypothesis and theories</li>
<li>Write up a report stating main effects and interactions that you hypothesize and be ready to explain why you think these effects will occur in the study. You should also be prepared with example data to show the PI so that they can get a better grasp of what your idea is.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you have done all this you will need to set up one more meeting with your PI and hone your project. Once you are ready, draft up any IRB forms you will need to run your study and revise and resubmit as necessary. But what if you want to get more out of your research experience and challenge yourself a little more?</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="psychology-honors-program">Psychology Honors Program<a class="headerlink" href="#psychology-honors-program" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the UW, the psychology department encourages students who perform exceptionally well in academics to pursue the psychology departmental honors program. This program is designed to be rigorous and to help students get a grasp of getting a Masters or PhD may entail. It is an intense research focused two year program that typically starts in the autumn of your Junior year. In order to be considered for the program students must contact a psychology advisor and make them aware of it towards the end of their Sophomore year. You will then be contacted by the advisor and Dr. Miriam Bassok who will interview you and determine if you qualify for the Psychology Honors Program.</p>
<p>Here are the Departments requirements for the Psychology Honors Program:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GPA Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>The Psych Honors Program requires an overall UW GPA of a 3.50 to start the program (or a grade very close to a 3.50), and a 3.50 GPA to graduate with departmental honors. (Note: For new transfer students who do not have a UW GPA, you may audit the Psych 350 class in the autumn and then, in December, when your grades are in, we can make you an official part of our program and register you for Psych 350)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>During the course of the program students will need to register for a total of 12 Credits of Psych 498-499, 4 credits of Psych 350, and 4 Credits of Psych 450. The 8 Credits of Psych 350 and 450 will count as W-credits. Finally if you complete your Junior Research Proposal you will get your lab class waved required to complete a degree in psychology here at the UW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paper Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>As a part of Psych 350 and 450, student must complete their Junior Research proposal and their Senior Thesis to gain credits in these two classes. Until these documents are submitted one will receive an incomplete for the quarter in these classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Trajectory</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Autumn, Junior Year: Psych 350, 2 cr.</strong></p>
<p>The first (and only) class you take for the Honors Program occurs in the Autumn of your Junior Year and is taught by Dr. Miriam Bassok. In this class, Dr. Bassok will invite many of our faculty members to visit and give one hour long presentations about themselves, their history in research psychology, what their research lab is currently working on, and, perhaps, ideas they have for undergraduate research projects in their lab. Since these faculty members are from all over our department, this can be a really interesting course. The goal is for students to find a faculty member who is willing to serve as their sponsor for their honors research project. You may find a sponsor from this class, from a research experience you have already had, through the Psych website or through a personal connection or recommendation given to you by Dr. Bassok.</p>
<p><strong>Winter, Junior Year</strong></p>
<p>During this quarter, you will start working as a Psych 499 student in your faculty member's lab - getting to know how research is conducted, how the experiments were designed, and what resources are available. You will spend this time getting to know more about your lab and coming up with ideas for research projects.</p>
<p><strong>Spring, Junior Year</strong></p>
<p>During this quarter, you will be working with your faculty member on your Junior Research Proposal - which will include a literature review.</p>
<p><strong>Autumn - Winter, Senior Year</strong></p>
<p>During these two quarters, you will be running your proposed experiment and collecting and analyzing your data.</p>
<p><strong>Spring, Senior Year</strong></p>
<p>Your poster presentation of your research project is due in mid-May and your final thesis is due in early June.</p>
</li>

<h3 id="debunking-stereotypes-presentation">Debunking Stereotypes Presentation<a class="headerlink" href="#debunking-stereotypes-presentation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Debunking Stereotypes is one of the presentations that are lab gives to showcase our work on the influence of masculine work environments in STEM fields. It is a great opportunity to get some experience with giving talks, public speaking, and raising awareness of what our lab does and what we research. This talk is roughly 30-45 minutes long to present. Before presenting this talk, are expected to read the papers that are cited.</p>
<p>To access the most recent version of the talk’s presentation, log into the SIBL Gmail account and go to Google Slides. The presentation should be labeled as “[JAN 2019] Debunking Stereotypes.” This talk can be split up so that 3 people can present it.</p>
<p>Person 1: Slides 1-12 and 51-53</p>
<p>Person 2: Slides 13-19, 23-26, and 37-42</p>
<p>Person 3: Slides 20-22, 27-36, and 43-50.</p>
<p>The talk is split this way so that the first person will introduce the goals and backstory of how this study came about, as well as summarizing the talk as a whole at the end. The second person will talk about current stereotypes within Computer Science, Engineering, and Physics fields. The third person will talk about what to do to change those stereotypes and the studies that were conducted.</p>
<p>When presenting, you will need to bring paper pamphlet handouts with you. These can be found in the Debunking Stereotypes box in lab. The lab manager can help you find these. Make sure to count how many you brought with you and how many you have left after the talk so that we can make sure we have enough copies for the next time we present this talk.</p>
