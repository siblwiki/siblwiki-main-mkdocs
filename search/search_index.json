It is key to determining where within your interests you can expand upon psychological knowledge. Once you have taken this step arrange to meet with the PI to discuss your independent project. If the PI sees that your interests align with what the lab is studying, and what our funding can cover, you will be either asked to brainstorm some ideas based on psychological literature or explore one of several topics assigned to you by the PI. They will most likely ask you to think about where there are \u201choles in the research\u201d You will need to do three things:</p> <ol> <li>Explore what the research has yet to find out about a particular topic. This can be done by looking at the future directions section of the paper, and reading other articles cited within the paper or that use similar keywords.</li> <li>Once you have completed your preliminary research, you will then come up with some sort of study design, and think about your general hypothesis and theories</li> <li>Write up a report stating main effects and interactions that you hypothesize and be ready to explain why you think these effects will occur in the study. You should also be prepared with example data to show the PI so that they can get a better grasp of what your idea is.</li> </ol> <p>After you have done all this you will need to set up one more meeting with your PI and hone your project. Once you are ready, draft up any IRB forms you will need to run your study and revise and resubmit as necessary.

This program is designed to be rigorous and to help students get a grasp of getting a Masters or PhD may entail. It is an intense research focused two year program that typically starts in the autumn of your Junior year. In order to be considered for the program students must contact a psychology advisor and make them aware of it towards the end of their Sophomore year. You will then be contacted by the advisor and Dr. Miriam Bassok who will interview you and determine if you qualify for the Psychology Honors Program.</p> <p>Here are the Departments requirements for the Psychology Honors Program:</p> <ul> <li> <p>GPA Requirements:</p> <p>The Psych Honors Program requires an overall UW GPA of a 3.50 to start the program (or a grade very close to a 3.50), and a 3.50 GPA to graduate with departmental honors. (Note: For new transfer students who do not have a UW GPA, you may audit the Psych 350 class in the autumn and then, in December, when your grades are in, we can make you an official part of our program and register you for Psych 350)</p> </li> <li> <p>Class Requirements:</p> <p>During the course of the program students will need to register for a total of 12 Credits of Psych 498-499, 4 credits of Psych 350, and 4 Credits of Psych 450. The 8 Credits of Psych 350 and 450 will count as W-credits. Finally if you complete your Junior Research Proposal you will get your lab class waved required to complete a degree in psychology here at the UW.</p> </li> <li> <p>Paper Requirements:</p> <p>As a part of Psych 350 and 450, student must complete their Junior Research proposal and their Senior Thesis to gain credits in these two classes.

In this class, Dr. Bassok will invite many of our faculty members to visit and give one hour long presentations about themselves, their history in research psychology, what their research lab is currently working on, and, perhaps, ideas they have for undergraduate research projects in their lab. Since these faculty members are from all over our department, this can be a really interesting course. The goal is for students to find a faculty member who is willing to serve as their sponsor for their honors research project. You may find a sponsor from this class, from a research experience you have already had, through the Psych website or through a personal connection or recommendation given to you by Dr. Bassok.</p> <p>Winter, Junior Year</p> <p>During this quarter, you will start working as a Psych 499 student in your faculty member's lab - getting to know how research is conducted, how the experiments were designed, and what resources are available. You will spend this time getting to know more about your lab and coming up with ideas for research projects.</p> <p>Spring, Junior Year</p> <p>During this quarter, you will be working with your faculty member on your Junior Research Proposal - which will include a literature review.</p> <p>Autumn - Winter, Senior Year</p> <p>During these two quarters, you will be running your proposed experiment and collecting and analyzing your data.</p> <p>Spring, Senior Year</p> <p>Your poster presentation of your research project is due in mid-May and your final thesis is due in early June.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Other%20Resources/UW%20RA%20Opportunities/#debunking-stereotypes-presentation","title":"Debunking Stereotypes Presentation","text":"<p>Debunking Stereotypes is one of the presentations that are lab gives to showcase our work on the influence of masculine work environments in STEM fields.

The analyzer should let checkers know if there are additional exclusion criteria for their study and point the checker to the preregistration (if applicable).</p> <p>The naming of variables on the data files is not always very straightforward. To avoid mistakes, checkers should always reference the questionnaire for what variables refer to and not just assume from their name.</p> <p>Checkers should be liberal about commenting on their own syntax or the script. They should also put a header on their syntax to record their name, date, the name of the project, and who they are reconciling with.

For example, in the figure, the checker would say to themselves, \u201cWhat is the mean for Arab male applicants,\u201d identify that number in their own output, and make sure the number they have in their head matches what is in the writeup.</p> <p>Checkers using SPSS should also double click the output table and be extra careful with numbers that end in 5, since this is where rounding errors might happen. For example, the number 370.1945 should be 370.19 after rounding, but it could be shown as 370.195 on the default output table, which might mislead the analyzer to round it to 370.20.</p> <p>Mediation analysis involves bootstrapping, which will make the CI slightly different each time the analysis is run.
