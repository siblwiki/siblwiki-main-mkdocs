Below is a short checklist of some onboarding logistics when first starting at UW. Most of these may only be relevant to postdocs, but some are applicable to graduate students. If you have any questions about these, please ask the lab manager and they can provide you with more information.

---

1. Complete the Human Subjects tutorial – CITI training
	- You must complete the training before running any subjects
	- Follow this [instruction](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/training/required-training/human-subjects-protections-training/) to complete the training
	- When you are done, they will email a certificate of completion that you can download and upload it to the server (/Volumes/SIBL/0 Admin/RA apps and 499 materials/CITI Forms).

2. Create Zipline account 
	- This is where IRB applications are submitted

3. Fill out Workday paperwork

4. Get [Husky card](https://hfs.uw.edu/Husky-Card-Services/Husky-Card)
	- You will need your student or employee ID number and state- or federally issued photo identification
	- Can get it from ground floor in Odegaard Undergraduate Library

5. Create [ORPP account](https://psych.uw.edu/research/resources/prp/login)
	- For creating studies and posting timeslots for UW undergrad pool

6. Obtain PsyCal access
	- For reserving rooms, request keys, and checking out equipment (e.g., projector)
	- [UW Psychology](https://psych.uw.edu/) -> Intranet -> Log in with UW NetID

7. Get a lab key 
	- Requires a $10 cash deposit that you get back when you turn it back in
	- Request through PsyCal

8. Get added onto SIBL Teams account
	- Main form of e-communication used by the lab
	- Download [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app)
	- Ask lab manager to add you

9. Create [OSF](https://osf.io/) account

10. Send lab manager a photo and quick blurb about yourself for the SIBL website
	- Graduate students and postdocs in the lab are listed on the [SIBL website](https://depts.washington.edu/sibl/current-members/) in the “People” tab, under “Current Members”. 
	- Links to the curriculum vitaes are also encouraged. "People" page gets a lot of traffic and having a posted cv is a great way to participate in some passive networking and get your research out in the world.
