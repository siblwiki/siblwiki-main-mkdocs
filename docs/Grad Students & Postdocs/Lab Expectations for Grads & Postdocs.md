#### CWL Grad Meeting

- Graduate students and postdocs working with the lab are **required to attend** weekly 90-minute graduate meetings with the lab managers and other lab staff. 
	- Since we share our meeting with Dr. Clara Wilkins’ [SPIA lab](http://depts.washington.edu/spia/), their graduate students, postdocs, and lab manager will also attend as well. 

- These meetings usually consist of providing other attendees with feedback on manuscripts, study designs and stimuli, grant applications, job applications, etc.

#### SIBL RA Meeting

- Graduate students and postdocs are also **required to attend** weekly 1-hour lab meetings that include undergraduate RA’s and volunteers. 

- These meetings usually cover lab announcements and are a great place to get advice for current projects* or to participate in undergraduate research groups. 
	- Graduate students and postdocs are also expected to get feedback in these meetings because our undergraduate RAs and volunteers love learning about their projects. This usually happens once per quarter (or less depending on how many people want to present their project).

- If there is a time conflict (e.g., with TA, Office Hours), please let Sapna and the lab manager know.

#### Snacks Sign-up

- Graduate students and postdocs are expected to sign up for bringing snacks to SIBL RA Meeting when we meet in person. 

- Food costs are offset by Sapna. 

- See lab managers for food funds and ways to receive the money.

#### Storing scientific materials and data

- Any research and data done in the lab (including surveys, IRB materials, data analyses, data coding, etc.) need to be saved in (e.g., SIBL server) and shared with (e.g., Qualtrics, Google Drive) SIBL lab account in addition to your own storage locations.

- For IRB materials, please save a copy of all the materials on the server: 
	```
	0 IRBs_reorganized/ Your Name (e.g., Sapna Cheryan) / IRB #_Project Name (e.g., 16200_Mattering 2).
	``` 
	- Feel free to save another copy in your folder if you think it would be easier for you to access.

- Other data can be saved in the quarterly folder under your name (e.g., 61 Fall / Linh / Project Name)

#### Mentorship

- Graduate students and postdocs are expected to be thoughtful mentors to more junior members in the lab. Our undergraduate RAs benefit from the mentor’s support, skills, wisdom, and coaching. 
	- This includes attending lab meetings, providing constructive feedback, answering questions, getting to know others, suggesting resources, etc.

- Balancing between one’s own work and mentorship obligations is also important. If this is too burdensome, graduate students and postdocs can communicate with Sapna or lab managers.

#### Communication

- The work carried in the lab greatly depends on **good communication** between everyone to ensure instructions are given and receive accurately as well as the progress is updated regularly. 
	- This includes responding to RA’s inquiries quickly, providing the best way to be reached by RAs and others, setting expectations about communication with RAs, keeping Sapna updated on what you need and challenges that may come up.

- For new graduate students and postdocs, Sapna typically does weekly meetings. However, as time goes on, it is up to the graduate students and postdocs if they would like to meet less frequently.
