Below are Sapna’s guidelines for providing feedbacks.

---

#### First draft recommendation letters 
(Meaning the first time Sapna written a rec letter of any kind for you)

- **2 weeks:** Subsequent rec letters; Papers more than 20 pages; OSF materials and data that will be made public

- **1 week**: Papers less than 20 pages; Questionnaires; IRBs; Data reports; Applications; Preregistrations; Slides

- **2 business days:** Anything quick that doesn’t require Sapna to provide comments or look anything up (e.g., signatures, quick question about launching a study)

**Note**: * Business days = regular workdays (e.g., not holidays, weekends, vacations)

#### **A few other guidelines:**

-   Even if you are under these times, you can still check in with Sapna to see if she would have time to give feedback on something in less time

-   Getting Sapna’s feedback on writing, data, etc is also a great way to use your 1:1 meeting with her and get feedback quickly

-   If you know in advance that you will need feedback over a specific set of days, you can get that in Sapna’s calendar ahead of time

-   It also helps Sapna to know if you can wait longer than these guidelines (e.g., if you don’t need a signature within 2 days, she will prioritize more urgent tasks). Giving Sapna a date for when you need something by helps her keep organized as well
