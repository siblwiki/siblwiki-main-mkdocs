Postdocs and graduate students are **free to hire their own research assistants** (RA) through:

- Accessing the applicant pool that applies through the SIBL website or UW’s 499 page (see “SIBL RA App” survey in the Lab Manager folder on SIBL Qualtrics account). 

- Classes you teach or TA

- Organizations you are a part of, etc. 


It is up to you whether you want the potential RA to complete the SIBL RA application or go through some other method of assessing their interest, qualifications, etc. If you do not want to hire your own RAs in a particular quarter, you are welcome to check with the lab managers to see whether there is extra RA time available to help on shorter-term projects. The **lab managers will communicate with Sapna** to assess where the task will fall in terms of *lab priorities*.

The SIBL Lab Manager will typically begin the hiring process for RAs in the final 2-3 weeks of the quarter. Based on their answers to the short questions on the RA application, the lab manager will then invite applicants for a short interview, after which a handful of RAs will be sent offers. With our lab’s commitment to diversity and inclusivity, we appreciate graduate students and postdocs’ effort in helping to recruit Underrepresented Minority (URM) RAs.

### RA Commitment

- All selected RAs are expected to **commit to a minimum of two quarters with SIBL with 9 hours/wee**k. After this initial commitment is completed, you can discuss future involvement with the lab and if they would like to reduce their hours (the minimum is 6 hours/week). You should communicate with your RA(s) about establishing recurring hours, so you know when they’re working, as well as start and end dates for each quarter. 

- Additionally, it is your responsibility to delegate tasks for your RA(s); even if you don’t have tasks related to your projects on a given week, it is still your responsibility to find something for them to do.

### RA Onboarding

Before being allowed to run subjects or handle data, RAs must complete the CITI certification training for human subjects online.

- This [link](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/training/required-training/human-subjects-protections-training/), will take them to a site that provides an overview of the training.
- This [other link](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/training/required-training/web-based-citi-training/) contains specific instructions on how to register for an account and which course to select.
- The course takes a few hours, and when they are done, it will allow them to email themselves a certificate of completion that they can forward to you and/or can upload to the server (/Volumes/SIBL/0 Admin/RA apps and 499 materials/CITI Forms). Make sure to remind them to name the file according to other files already in the server.

Additionally, please send the name and contact email of the RA(s) you have recruited to the lab manager so they can be added to the SIBL Teams account. At the beginning of each quarter, the lab manager will do a brief group orientation with all new RAs so they get to learn about the structure of SIBL and other logistical pieces of information (e.g., accessing the server).
