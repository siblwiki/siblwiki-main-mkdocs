## Books

![[File Images Holder/Books and Articles/uwLibrary.png]]

Simply type the title of the book or article you would like to find on the search bar. There are advanced options if you want to search strictly within a database or within certain fields (Author, Title, Keyword, etc.)

This will bring up a listing of all relevant titles. Some may not be what you are looking for but it is likely you will find what you want, as this search engine does not only search the UW Catalog. It also searches the Summit (catalog for a collection of schools in the Pacific Northwest) and Worldcat (global) Catalog.

The UW has an agreement with these libraries that allows us to borrow materials from their archives and have them delivered to the closest UW Library, which in Guthrie is the Chemistry Library, right across the street. If a book is not available in the UW Library system, it may very well be available somewhere else in the Summit Catalog. As pictured below, when a book is not available at UW, the library’s search engine will provide a list of how many copies are held by other schools within the Summit and Worldcat Catalog system and, of those, how many are available.

In the image above, you’ll see how many copies of the book UW owns, the availability of those copies, and, if not available, when that book is due. You can choose to put a hold on the UW copy of the book or to request it from Summit & Worldcat Libraries (just click on the link; from there, it is self-explanatory). Delivery usually takes one to two weeks if the book is not out on loan when you request it. Delivery from one UW Library to another usually takes about 48 hours. If you request a book be delivered, make sure you mark you have done so on the book list, as we don’t want to request multiple copies of the same book!
    
## Articles
 There are two easy-to-use search engines for journal articles: Google Scholar and PsycINFO.

### Google Scholar

To get to Google Scholar on campus, simply follow this URL:[http://scholar.google.com/](http://scholar.google.com/)

Google Scholar allows you to search for journal articles just as you would search for anything else using the Google Search Engine. You can type in a journal title, an author’s name, or an article title into the search bar. On the results page on the right-hand side, there will be additional links to the full-text (i.e., “Check for Full-Text @ UW”). Clicking on that will lead you to downloadable PDFs.

The benefit and downfall of Google Scholar is that it searches all academic publications, not just psychological publications. When searching broadly for research in a particular area, you may wish to limit what types of journals you search. In order to do a more specific search, find the down arrow on the upper right hand side of the webpage, it should be next to the “My Citations” box. Once you click the arrow, “Advanced Search” will be the third option down

More detailed search options will appear under the search bar:

Click on “Advanced Scholar Search” to limit the scope of your search to Social Science Journals or to a certain publication date range or author. There are a number of options under the advanced search menu – just choose the options that best fit the parameters of your search.

### PsycINFO
PsycInfo is a database of all scholarly journals relevant to psychology. It includes everything from clinical psychology journals to organization behavior journals. It can be a little tough to find on the UW Libraries website, so just go to the UW Libraries Psychology page and click the “PsycINFO” link from there: 

[Library Guides: Psychology: Top Resources](http://guides.lib.washington.edu/psychology) 

![[File Images Holder/Books and Articles/uwLibraryGuides.png]]

1. Click on the Article tab (2nd tab); 2. Click PsycINFO

Unlike Google Scholar, PsycINFO searches only psychology publications (as well as a few other relevant publications, such as business, marketing, etc.). It allows you to search articles grouped by author, keyword, title, or journal, although the user interface tends to be less user-friendly than Google Scholar. The advantage is that you can get a fairly comprehensive list of relevant articles (whereas in Google Scholar you typically have to wade through a significant amount of more irrelevant info). One good rule of thumb is to use Google Scholar when you have a particular article in mind that you are looking for but to use PsycINFO when you are initiating broader searches.

In the search bar, you can choose to search by keyword, author, title, or journal. We will generally provide you with the title, authors or keywords, so you won’t have to worry about this too much. After typing in an author’s name, you’ll get a count of their publications, as well as a list of titles and abstracts, as follows:

![[File Images Holder/Books and Articles/ebscoHost.png]]

From here, click on the title for the full citation, sometimes with PDFs.  If the full text is not available, click on “Check for UW Holdings” and follow instructions from there. Most journals are held within UW’s electronic catalog. If you do not find a link through UW, another way to find articles once you know which journal they are in is to go to the UW Ejournals website:

[](http://www.lib.washington.edu/types/ejournals/)

Enter in the name of the journal you are looking for, and it will often direct you to online copies of the articles.

### Saving Journal Articles and Book Chapters
Ideally, we want all articles and chapters saved in electronic format as **PDFs** in a folder dedicated to the research topic. You should be able to download articles directly from PsycINFO and Google Scholar. Occasionally, you may have to request an article from Summit, in which case it will be scanned and sent to you electronically.

For books, if UW holds the text you are looking for and electronic versions are not available, you may have to go to the library and make copies yourself. In this case, it is always preferable to return to Guthrie with the text and make copies using the lab’s copy code. If this is not possible, talk to Sapna or the grad RA and they will sort something out for you.

Once copies are made, use the Guthrie photocopier to scan in the documents and create electronic versions and have them emailed to you. See “Printing in Lab and in the Copy Room for details on how to do this.

Save all articles to the specified folder on the server in the following format:

| Number of authors | PDF Format |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| One authors | [author last name] et al. [publication year] [publication abbreviated title].pdf |
| Two authors | [author last name] et al. [publication year] [publication abbreviated title].pdf |
| Multiple authors | [author last name] et al. [publication year] [publication abbreviated title].pdf |
    
    
    When all of the articles and chapters have been found, email the primary investigator on the project and let them know the lit search is complete
