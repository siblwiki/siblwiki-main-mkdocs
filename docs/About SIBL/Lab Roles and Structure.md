Lab groups are made up of a variety of contributing individuals. All are held to the high expectations and all make important contributions to the research that is undertaken in the lab. Labs have a variety of personnel working in them, with varying levels of commitment and various reasons to be there. The cast of characters are included below but visit our [lab website](https://depts.washington.edu/sibl/current-members/) to see current members.

### Principal Investigator (P.I.)

Dr. Sapna Cheryan is the professor in-charge and the head of the lab. She is the intellectual guide behind the projects in the lab and decides on the long-term and short-term direction of the lab. In addition to running the lab, she is responsible for advising graduate students and honors students, writing grants to fund the lab and graduate students, sharing the findings by publishing the results, presenting the research in talks and at conferences, and teaching classes.

### Post-Docs

Post-docs have already earned their doctoral degree, typically from another university, and are continuing research and gaining skills to use in their career. They primarily conduct research, write research papers, and write grants. Post-docs are typically in lab between 2-3 years and will often go on the job market during their time in lab.

### Graduate Students

Graduate students conduct research that is required for their Ph.D. in psychology. Generally, they work long hours and have a lot of time and emotion invested in their own projects and those of their advisor. They may also contribute to organizational and administrative aspects of the lab at the same time as conducting research and writing up research reports. Graduate students have their own projects and become increasingly independent during their 4-6 years in the laboratory.

### Lab Manager(s)

A lab manager spends more time on administrative tasks than other RAs. They will be in charge of scheduling studies and lab hours, as well as preparing materials for studies. They tend to know a lot about the procedures and methods we use in lab and are a go-to person for questions regarding the daily operations of the lab. In some years, there is another full-time or part-time lab manager who assists with data analysis and checking.

### Honors Students

Honors students are advanced undergraduate psychology majors working with a lab member on an independent research project. Their work is generally their own, but is related to the methods or theories used in the lab. They typically work under the guidance of a graduate student on their project and may or may not also be involved on other projects in the lab.

### Senior Research Assistants

Senior RAs are volunteers or students who have been with the lab for 3 quarters or longer and have made significant contributions to the research at SIBL. In order to qualify for this position RAs must meet the following criteria:

- Been in SIBL for at least 3 quarters
- Programmed at least 1 survey in Qualtrics
- Created at least 1 data report
- Be familiar with lab protocols
- Attended lab meeting for at least 2 quarters
- Ran participants in at least 2 studies (can be on campus, in lab, etc)
- Be willing and able to answer questions from other RAs
- Can mediate between the lab manager and the other RAs

Once an RA becomes a Senior RA they can take a larger role in the research projects, have more choice over the tasks they work on and take on more responsibilities as needed. Any RAs that are interested in becoming a Senior RA should feel free to talk with their graduate mentor or the lab manager about the steps in the process.

### Research Assistant (RA, 499, or REU)

Research assistants are absolutely vital to the success of SIBL. They are usually undergraduate students enrolled in Psychology 499: Psychology Undergraduate Research for credit toward a B.A. or B.S. in psychology. RAs may also be volunteers from other schools, the community, or UW who are working in the lab to gain experience as they consider working in the field of research. Generally, these individuals commit between 6 and 9 hours a week to the lab.

People often come to the lab from a wide range of backgrounds, but the most important qualifications are conscientiousness, an eagerness to learn, interest in the research process, and good organizational skills. Because of the extensive training involved, there is a minimum commitment of at least two quarters in our lab (with the exception of summer RAs, who may work more hours but only work during the summer). Research assistants help out with all aspects of the research process, including running and designing experiments, interviewing subjects, preparing stimuli, performing literature searches, coding, entering and analyzing data, and attending weekly lab meetings. Their time is occupied mostly by the physical running of laboratory studies.
