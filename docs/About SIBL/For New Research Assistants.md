There are a few bureaucratic matters that must be taken care of before becoming a full-fledged lab member. These include registering with the department as either a 499 student or a volunteer and completing the human subjects’ tutorial. It is also optional to attend a Psychology human subjects meeting at the beginning of the quarter.

### Registering as a 499 or volunteer

**For PSYCH 499 Students**
- Register for 499 credit (either 2 or 3 credits depending on the number of hours you work per week - 6 hrs for 2 credits vs 9 hrs for 3 credits). 
- Before the quarter start, respond to your lab manager email with your information (name, student ID, email, # of credits). 
- Then, you will receive an add code from the Psychology Office Manager, which you can use to register for PSYCH 499.

**For volunteers (Non-UW Students)**

All volunteers and REU RAs in the psychology department must have:

- A background check done. Contact Melissa on the first floor (Payroll) to do this.
- Volunteer ID’s for UW use which need to be created at the front desk (do NOT have Melissa make the volunteer ID).
- Checked with the front desk (GTH 119A) on whether they need to complete the volunteer form (see Appendix), hard copies available on the first floor.
- CITI training certificate.

**All REU RAs must also do the following:**

- Complete UW Hires Profile
- Schedule with payroll staff to check I-9 and COVID Vaccination documentation
- Go through WorkDays and start add hours.
- Get [Husky card](https://hfs.uw.edu/Husky-Card-Services/Husky-Card)
	- You will need your student or employee ID number and state- or federally issued photo identification
	- Can get it from ground floor in Odegaard Undergraduate Library

### Completing the human subjects tutorial – CITI Training

Before being allowed to run subjects, you must complete the certification training for human subjects online. It takes an hour or two, and when you are done, it will allow you email a certificate of completion that you can bring it to the lab manager during your first week in the lab.

[Instructions](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/training/required-training/web-based-citi-training/) on the overall process.

Once you finish the training, please email/send a message through Microsoft Teams the PDF of your Certification in the following naming format: 
```
lastname_firstname_CITITrainingCertificate.pdf
```

Notes: 
1. Make sure you ONLY do the Basic course - Stage 1 "Research with Human Subjects"

2. You are not required to take notes or memorize any of the information

3. If you have already taken the training before, you can just take the Refresher course

---

### Chain of Command

A certain chain of command is followed when a question arises.

1. If a question is in relation to a **specific study**, you can directly ask the **graduate student** who is supervising the study, or you can ask the **lab manager**.

3. Utilize your resources. Try to find the answer yourself first.

5. If you still cannot figure it out, talk to **other RAs** in the lab. Questions for other RAs would be things like, “What rooms are available?”, “Can you help me decipher this handwriting for data entry?”, or other logistical things like how to print in lab or program a survey.

7. If it is still not resolved and the **lab manager** is available, then bring the issue to them.

9. Generally, **if you have a question you want to ask Sapna**, ask the **lab manager** first. If it is urgent that you ask Sapna personally, you can approach her before or after lab meeting; non-urgent questions can also be asked during 1-on-1s with Sapna (which occur bi-quarterly).

### Scheduling Lab Hours Instructions

We ask that SIBL RAs put their lab hours into the **shared SIBL Google Calendar.**

It is very important because lab manager(s) need to know when each of you is working so they can assign you your tasks for the day. You are free to divide the 9 hours/week however you like and/or best fits your schedule (see screenshot below for example). Please just make sure to indicate if you are doing the hours remotely or in-person.

![[File Images Holder/New RAs/googleCalendar_example.png]]

If you want your hours to be the same each week (most RAs do), please create a recurring event (**until specified date)** (last day of instruction for specified quarter). 

Lab manager(s) typically work 9am-5pm PT Monday through Friday, so that's when they are available via Teams/email. BUT, you are free to schedule hours outside of those hours (although that does mean I won't be as easy to reach).

**SIBL Account**

- Contact lab manager for SIBL log-in credentials

**Instructions**

1. You can access the SIBL google account with the above credentials.
	- When you try to log in for the first time, it will ask for a **confirmation number.**
	- The number will be sent to lab manager so **please let me know before you enter the login info**. You both will get on a quick Zoom call or both be in Teams chat so lab manager can give you the number.

2. Open the Google Calendar app and go to the specified week.

3. Enter in when you are available by creating an event in your calendar. To create an event, click on the date and time you would like to mark. In the *Calendar* section, use the drop down menu to select the calendar with your name.
    
    ![[File Images Holder/New RAs/googleCalendar_instruction.png]]
    
    ![[File Images Holder/New RAs/googleCalendar_inputEvent.png]]

4. In the *What* section, enter your name. The event should include the hours you will be able to work in lab (e.g., Mondays from 12:30pm to 3:30pm).

### Accessing SIBL Server

#### HUSKY ONNET

For all of this to work, you will need to download [Husky OnNet](https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/uw-networks/about-husky-onnet/use-husky-onnet/) which gives you access to the UW network from remote locations. The link should include instructions for how to install for Mac and Windows.

You will need your UW credentials to access the UW network each time. If you forget to disconnect from the UW network, sometimes your computer may have a hard time connecting the next time you try to access it. This can be fixed by opening the “BIG-IP Edge Client” application and disconnecting and reconnecting.

#### ACCESSING THE SIBL SERVER

##### Credentials:
- IP Address: 172.25.226.40
- Contact lab manager for username and password

##### If you use WINDOWS:
1.  Open up “File Explorer” and then go to “This PC”
2.  From the tabs across the top, select “Computer”. You should see an option for “Map network drive”

![[File Images Holder/For New Research Assistants/siblserver_windows1.png]]

3.  Click on it and it’ll prompt you to enter an IP address. Enter \\172.25.226.40
    1.  The Drive letter is pretty arbitrary, just pick a random letter
    2.  Check the “Reconnect at sign-in” checkbox
4.  From the list of many folders, find and select “SIBL”
5.  It will prompt you to enter credentials, which are the username and password listed above
6.  The server should now appear in your “Network locations” area of “This PC”

![[File Images Holder/For New Research Assistants/siblserver_windows2.png]]

You now have access to the server!

Alternatively, you can use the following method too (thank you Jillian for pointing this out) → USE THIS METHOD, IT”S MUCH EASIER

1.  Click on the Windows icon, then click run (or search for it), and type in “ \\172.25.226.40 ”. Press “OK”.
2.  From the list of folders in the Psych Server, find and open “sibl”
3.  Enter the username and password
4.  Drag the sibl folder to the Desktop to create a shortcut

##### If you use MacOS:
1.  From the “Finder” menu at the top of your screen, click on the “Go” drop-down menu and select “Connect to Server…”. In the “Server Address:” box enter “smb://[172.25.226.40](http://172.25.226.40/)” and click the “Connect” button.
2.  In the “Click Connect to continue” dialog box, click “Connect”.
3.  You will then be asked for the lab’s username and password for the server which you can find above.
    1.  I would recommend checking the “Remember this password in my keychain” box.
    2.  To finish authenticating simply click the final “Connect” button.
4.  A scrollable list of all the shared folders on the server will be displayed. Find the folder you need, highlight it with a single click and click “OK”. A disk icon for the folder will appear on your desktop and the contents of the folder will also be displayed.
5.  To finish up, create a new alias to the shared folder. Click once on the disk icon to highlight it, go back to the “Finder” menu at the top of the screen, click on the “File” drop-down menu and select “Make Alias”. The new alias will appear next to the disk icon.
    1.  All you will have to do the next time is double click the alias to bring up the shared folder.
