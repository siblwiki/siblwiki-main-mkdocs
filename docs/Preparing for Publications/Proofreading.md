The main purpose of proofreading is **to improve the quality of the paper, ensuring there are no lingering mistakes, and correcting generalized discourse errors or writing inconsistencies**. Proofreading is important because it helps to ensure that the finished product is accurate and error-free. Errors can vary from minor typos to more significant statistical or grammatical mistakes.

### Clarity
1. Do an initial read-through for **clarity issues**, sentences that could sound better, be simplified, or written in active voice
2. Read all text (out loud or backward by sentence) – including figure captions, footnotes, etc.

### In APA 7 Style
3. Check **APA 7th style** (especially headings) - See [APA Style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines) for styles and grammar
4. Pay special attention to **verb tense** because we have bad habit of switching from past to present (e.g., "we predict" vs. "we predicted") - See [APA Style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/grammar/verb-tense) for correct use of verb tense
5. Look through references and mark any errors with Comments and Track Changes - See [APA Style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples) for examples of correct reference format
	- Does the reference contain DOI, volumn, issue, page numbers, editors (for book chapter), etc.?
	- Is the journal paper title in lower-case?

### Accuracy
6. Make sure title on cover page matches title on intro page
7. Check **figures and tables** to make sure bars (figures) and numbers (tables) **match** up to what is in or implied by the text.
8. Check to make sure figures and tables are **referenced properly** in the text (e.g., Figure 1 is actually matched with Figure 1).
9. Check footnotes to make sure they are numbered correctly and their position in the text makes sense
10. Proofread cover letter (if there is one)
11. Check if arithmetic means in results section match the text (e.g., mean should be higher for condition that generated “greater anger”)
12. Check variable names to make sure they don’t shift around in a confusing manner (e.g., anticipated success vs. performance expectations, interest vs. course enrollment intentions)
