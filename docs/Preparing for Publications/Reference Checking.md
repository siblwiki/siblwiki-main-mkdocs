This is when a paper is getting ready for review, and the references need validating.

1. There are multiple steps to this process. Initially, the papers will need to be looked up and collected as PDFs into one folder on the server. They should be saved in the following format:
    
    > [authors last names]  [year] [journal of publication]

2. Next, they need to be cross-checked with the paper. Go back to the paper and read what the reference is supporting, then find evidence for that support in the article. **Highlight the relevant parts** of the article and save it. If it's on Google Drive, you can highlight the parts and comments: study/project name, page number. Enter the page number of the evidence in Column E.

Usually reference checks are organized through a sheet on Google Drive:

When a reference is checked, the RA who checked it documents their name along with a color: **green** means the article contains supportive evidence, **orange** means it’s questionable, and **red** means it does not have supportive evidence.

They will also verify that it is in the folder on the server, and in the reference pages of the paper. Any additional comments can be noted in the “Notes” section. This can include page numbers where the support is found, questions about the support, and more.
