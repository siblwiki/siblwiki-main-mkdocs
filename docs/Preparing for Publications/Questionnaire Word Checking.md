A process by which **we check that our *measures* are accurate in our papers**. To do this, RAs check either the **hard copies** of the paper surveys or the **Qualtrics survey** online **against the wording we have reported in the latest draft of the paper**.

Steps:

1. Find the correct survey on Qualtrics or get the folder with the paper (hard-copy) surveys from the file cabinets in the lab.
2. **Check against the methods section of the paper**: When you have found the section of the paper where we talk about our questionnaire you will highlight red or green depending on whether or not it matches the paper/Qualtrics survey.

	**Note**. Sometimes the lab manager will simply send you the relevant section via email or Microsoft Teams.
			
	**Example section**: *In Study 2, 193 undergraduate students filled out a paper survey on campus. They were asked 2 questions about their choice of major: “How likely would you be to choose a major that is boring?” and “How interested would you be in choosing a major that is exciting?”. Answers were reported on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 “Not at all” to 7 “Very likely”."*

	**Your Tasks:** 
	- Highlight any words/phrases/sentences that are inaccurately reported in the paper **red**.
	- Highlight any words/phrases/sentences that are accurately reported in the paper **green**.
	- Put comments on the red highlighted sections that say what the correct wording should be.
	
	Send the paper/relevant section back to the lab manager with the highlights and comments. 

3. Very important to **let the lab manager/your supervisor know if you **notice** anything strange**. Even if it seems small to you, it could be a big issue later on if not corrected!
