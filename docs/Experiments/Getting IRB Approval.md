## **Overview**

UW’s IRB is call the Human Subjects Division. They handle all concerns related to submitting IRBs, modifications to studies, and status reports. The Psychology Department is assigned to IRB committee E/B led by Galen Basse ([gkbasse@uw.edu](mailto:gkbasse@uw.edu)). You can go to him with general IRB questions.

## Types of IRBs

- Our lab typically submits exempt or minimal risk IRBs. These are the lowest grades of IRBs. Exempt is the least risk and minimal risk is slightly higher risk. HSD has guides on which IRB types should be used.

## Zipline
IRB applications at UW are processed through [Zipline](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/zipline/). The forms you will you need to fill out/create are: information statements/consent forms, IRB protocol document ([provided by HSD](https://www.washington.edu/research/forms-and-templates/zipline-application-irb-protocol/)), materials & questionnaires, recruitment materials, debrief document (optional), and grant application (if funding is being used to pay for participant compensation). You can find templates for these materials on the server (/Volumes/SIBL/0 Study Templates) or [UW HSD](https://approachingblog.wordpress.com/2018/01/24/powering-your-interaction-2/) for the most up-to-date protocol.

- Zipline is the online IRB system where you submit applications and forms.
- You can make a Zipline account using your UW Net ID on this page: [https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/zipline/](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/zipline/).
- All materials and studies must be approved by Sapna before submission.

## Preparing materials for IRB

- Fill out Zipline form
- Create any necessary documents such as consent form, debrief forms, materials and questionnaires
- One important thing to note is that 3 information statements will need to be created – ORPP, Prolific, and MTurk. By listing all three as options within the IRB protocol document and having all three information statements, it gives you the flexibility to draw from different participant pools if that’s the direction of your project.

If you need any help or have any questions about any of the components of the IRB application, please ask the lab manager for assistance.
