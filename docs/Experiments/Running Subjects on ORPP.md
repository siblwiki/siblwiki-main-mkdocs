The **Online Research Pool Program (ORPP)** is the website through which participants from psychology classes sign-up for our studies. The system allows us to post study timeslots, see how many participants are scheduled for those slots, grant subjects credit for participating in studies.

The night before participants are scheduled to show up, the website sends members of our lab an email reminding us what timeslots are filled and by how many subjects. As such, the first things you will do when your lab hours begin is to open ORPP and see how many subjects you have and when they are coming in.

## Navigating ORPP 

1. Double click on the ORPP login shortcut located on the toolbar or favorite of the web browser or find the website by typing in ORPP UW into Google or another search engine.

6. Participants can sign up 30 minutes prior to a study. Be sure to check your timeslots for last minute sign ups! Note: We use code names to keep track of all of our studies (e.g. ‚ÄúPerceptions‚Äù), so that we don‚Äôt reveal the purpose of the study to the participants. You will become familiar with these as you get more involved in the lab setting.

7. You should now see all the timeslots available for your study along with listings of who is signed up for those slots. The layout is split into two different sections - Recent Timeslots, Upcoming Timeslots, Older Timeslots, and All Time Slots, For the most part, you will refer to the Recent Timeslots to see who is coming in next.

## Granting credit/No Shows

1. To grant credit or mark no shows in ORPP, all you need to do is click modify on the appropriate timeslot and then mark the appropriate option (i.e. participated, no show (unexcused), or no show excused).
    
    A **‚Äúno show (excused)‚Äù** absence occurs when a participant emails either to cancel their time slot or to explain why they failed to show up during their time slot. They do not need to have emailed ahead of time to be marked as an excused absence.
