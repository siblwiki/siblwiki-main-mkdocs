### Making a Data Template

If data that has been collected on campus needs to be entered and no data sheet exists already, you’ll need to create a data template.

1. Open a new file in Excel and save it with 
```
<study name> data <date>
E.g., Labor Market data 2.16.2023
```
2. If there is a logsheet, label one tab “logsheet,” the other “data”.
3. Choose variable names that are readable by SPSS, which means no weird symbols (i.e., #,*), variable names start with a letter, no spaces, and each variable is descriptive of the question but not too long (typically 6-12 characters).

	- For regular variables use camel case- lowercaseUppercaseUppercase
	- For variables we create to use in analyses (e.g. composite variables) use title case-TitleCase
	- Common demographics variable names: gender, genderOther, race, raceOther, citizen, bornUS, transgender, major
4. Freeze the top row on both the logsheet and the data tab by going to View > Freeze Top Row while on each tab.
5. Color code (Highlight tool) the worksheet so that every questionnaire page has a different color.
6. Save the file and then upload the file into the corresponding folder on the Psych server.

While some data is collected in the lab using Qualtrics and other tools, other data comes from hard-copy/paper questionnaires that RAs pass out around campus. Data from paper questionnaires need to be entered into the computer to be analyzed and stored. 
- Must go through a 3-step process: **entering, checking, and filing**. 
- Stored in the carts while it is being entered and checked, before being moved to the filing cabinets for long-term storage. 
- The data from these paper forms is entered into excel files that can be found within the experiment’s corresponding folder on the Psych server.

### Data Basket (Hanging Folders)

1. To Be Entered Folder- Questionnaires that have not been entered into the computer go into their hanging folder.
2. To Be Checked Folder- Questionnaires that have been entered are then moved into the “to be checked” folder
3. To Be Filed Folder- All questionnaires that have been entered and checked are then placed in the “to be filed” folder meaning that they are ready to go into the big filing cabinets.

### Entering Data

1. Using the server, navigate to the excel data sheet that corresponds to the study for which you need to enter data. Drag the excel file onto the desktop as outlined in the section, “Accessing Psych Server.” (Page 31) Double click the file on the desktop.

2. Starting with the first questionnaire, enter in all the appropriate information from left to right. Each questionnaire gets its own row in the spreadsheet. To check what you should be entering, look at the topmost row, which contains the variable names for the data (i.e. subject number).

![[File Images Holder/Handling Data/handlingDataExcel.png]]

In the above example, the variable name “cs_glasses” refers to the question “Please rate how much you associate glasses with computer science majors.” Subject #1 rated glasses as a 4, so we enter a 4 under that column.

3. Type in each response that corresponds to the question’s variable name on the top row. The responses to many questions (e.g. Likert Scales, etc.) will be numeric, but sometime you will have to enter in an open-ended response. If a question is left blank, highlight the corresponding cell in blue. To move to the next column hit tab (not enter). To move back a column, hit Shift+Tab

4. It’s important to establish a check point when entering data to make sure that you are inputting numbers in the correct cell. I like to use the start of every new page as my check point. Meaning, at the start of every new page, I read the first question and make sure it corresponds to the cell’s variable. If it does, then I know all my data is probably on track. If it doesn’t then it means I’ve skipped a cell, so I need to go back and retrace my steps till I find the cell I skipped.

    ![[File Images Holder/Handling Data/handlingDataPageBreak.png]]

Note. The excel data entry sheet can be color coded such that each page is represented by columns of a distinct color, which allows the data enterer to notice when they have skipped a cell, as the color will change too early. Above, the golden (first column) indicates all the questions which were on one page of the questionnaire. Light Blue (CO to CX) represents the next page of the questionnaire. Bright blue cells indicate that the participant did not fill in an answer for that question.

5. Once you have entered all the data from the questionnaire, type your name in under the column labeled entered by.

6. Continue this process with all other questionnaires that need to be entered.

7. Once finished, save the file by replacing the older version on the desktop with your newest one.

8. Then replace the old version of that file on Psych Server by dragging the newest version from the desktop back into the server.

**Things to remember**

Besides typing in numbers, we also enter responses that the subjects wrote on the survey. 
- E.g., we often ask the subject to provide what major he/she is pursuing and in what country he/she was born -> we write in these answers in a standardized way so that we can analyze our data properly. If we wanted to see how many psychology majors took our survey, we don’t want to search for ‘psych’, ‘Psych’, ‘psychology’, AND ‘Psychology.’ Same goes for ‘US’ or ‘USA’ citizens.

1. To standardize countries, the first person to type in a certain country decides how it should be written. If you see that someone has typed in ‘US’ before you and your survey says ‘USA’, you should enter ‘US’.

2. To standardize Majors, we have a few simple rules.
	- First word of major is capitalized, second is not: e.g. Political science
	- Omit excess words the participant writes:
		- e.g “Maybe fashion design I think” = Fashion design
	- Correct spelling and un-abbreviate:
		- e.g Comp Lit= Comparative literature
	- “Undeclared” “I don’t know” etc:
		- e.g Undecided
	- If there are two majors, put each into its separate column. If there are more than three majors, insert another column
	- If a major is unfamiliar, a quick search on Google should tell you
		- e.g Google “ACMS UW” should give you “Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences”

3. When a cell is left blank, highlight the cell BLUE

4. For free response questions, type exactly what the participant wrote. Try to match punctuation (e.g., “&”) with the appropriate symbols.

### Checking Data

After you’ve entered data into the computer, you still need someone to check it. It is important that the data is checked by someone different from the person that entered the data because this prevents mistakes being repeated by the same person and assures us that the data we are analyzing is correct.

1. Just as with entering data, start by navigating to the appropriate excel document on the Psych Server and open it on the desktop.

2. Grab a questionnaire; they will either be in the study box or in the hanging folders. Then, locate its row on the excel file. Usually, this can be done by finding the corresponding subject number.

3. Moving from left to right, check the two documents making sure the responses that have been entered in Excel match the responses on the questionnaire itself.

4. If there is a typo from the person who entered it, change it and highlight the altered cell in yellow. Be sure that blank answers are marked properly and that written responses are entered in the appropriate standardized manner explained in the ‘Entering Data’ section of the handbook.

5. Once finished checking all the data, type your name in the cell in the checked by column.
	- If there were any mistakes or other things you noticed, leave those in a notes column

6. Continue this process until all entered questionnaires have been checked.

7. Once finished, save the file by replacing the older version on the desktop with your newest one.

8. Then replace the old version of that file on the server by dragging the newest version from the desktop back into the server’s window where the old file is located.

There are some instances in which we data check **previous large datasets**. There is a multi-step process for approaching these larger datasets.

1. Create a column within the Excel file containing the clean data named “randNumber” and enter the function “=RAND()”. Drag this function down for all cases and now all participants should have a randomly generated number from 0-1.
	- Create a second column titled “randNumberStatic” and copy and paste the values from the first column as values. This will prevent the numbers from regenerating.

2. Calculate the number of responses that make up 10% of the total (For example, if there are 236 responses, we will check 24 of them). These will make up the 10% of cases we check.
	- Remember to include the first and last case as part of this 10%.

3. Sort the “randNumberStatic” column from largest to smallest and select the remaining number of cases to select the 10% we will check.

4. Use either the participant ID (for paper surveys) or Response ID (for Qualtrics surveys) to match the cases needing to be checked from a raw data file.
	- For Qualtrics surveys, you may need to revisit what the recode values for an item were to make sure you’re interpreting them correctly. For example, is a “1” for variable “gender1” for “woman” or “man”?

5. If the 10% of checked cases have no mistakes, then we stop data checking there. If we find mistakes within the 10%, then we will either data check another small batch from the larger dataset and/or data check all responses.

### Common Problems with Data Entry

<details>
<summary>The subject circled two numbers for one question</summary>
<br>If a subject circles two consecutive numbers with one circle (e.g., circling both the 4 and the 5), indicating that they can’t choose between the two, then you can enter the halfway point (e.g., 4.5). If the numbers are not consecutive, we assume they got confused and leave that answer blank.
</details>

<details>
<summary>The subject did not fill out the entire survey or there is a page missing
</summary>
<br> In this scenario, enter all the data that is given and highlight the cell blue in the parts where data is missing. Be sure to leave a note about it in the “notes” section of the data entry form (ex. Some parts from pg. 1 and demographics pg missing). If a page is missing, you should check the other surveys to make sure that the page isn’t missing from any other copies. If it is missing you will need to make new copies of the survey if it is still being run so we get a complete set of data from everybody.
</details>

<details>
<summary>You cannot read something that the subject wrote</summary>
<br>Try to get someone else’s opinion on the questionable word. If no one has a clue, you can enter your best guess or leave it blank. Make a note of your decision in the “notes” section on the data form.
</details>

<details>
<summary>The subject wrote something and then crossed it out</summary>
<br>If the subject wrote something else, enter that, though if the old answer had something interesting about it, comment on it in the “notes” section. If there is nothing else written down then you should use your best judgment as to whether or not what they crosses out would be useful or interesting to note. If it is, leave the cell blank but add a comment about it summarizing what they crossed out in the notes section.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Subject writes comments on the survey outside of the questions that were asked</summary>
<br> Use your best judgment to assess whether or not to make note of the comments in the “notes” section. If there are a bunch of doodles, you could note that perhaps the subject was not taking the study seriously. Or if there are a bunch of questions about what we’re studying, you could note that the subject was trying to guess the study as he/she filled it out. If you don’t know what to do, you may always ask for someone else’s opinion.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Subject’s answers seem ridiculous (place of birth = the moon; math classes taken = 578)</summary>
<br> Unfortunately, sometimes our subjects do not take our studies seriously. If there seems to be something questionable about the subject’s answers, enter it and make a note of it in the “notes” section so the researcher sees it and can decide how to handle it.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Subject circles the neutral number (e.g.. 4 out of 7) on the entire survey</summary>
<br>If a subject is circling a neutral number for the entire survey or most of the survey it could be an indication that the subject was bored and didn’t take the survey seriously. If this happens, enter in their answer on the data sheet but write a note stating that the subject mostly circled 4s and may have been bored or otherwise protesting the questions.
</details>

### Filing Data

After entering and checking data from questionnaires, we don’t throw them out since we now have a soft copy of everything on the computer. Instead we take the questionnaires, consent forms, logsheets and anything else pertaining to the study and store them in filing cabinets which are organized by the quarter and year. All the papers in the “TO BE FILED” folder in the questionnaire basket should go through the following process.

1. Collect all the papers in the “TO BE FILED” folder of the questionnaire basket and if needed, separate them in groups according to which study they belong to.
	- **Note –** not all papers that need to be filed will come from the basket. Consent forms and logsheets from studies run using the computers will also need to be filed; in this case they can be found in their appropriate filebox.

2. Check the filing cabinet to see if there has already been a hanging folder created for the study you are filing papers for.
	- If a hanging folder has not already been created…
	    1. In this case, you will to simply assemble and label the hanging folder for the study you are filing so start by grabbing a hanging folder (usually stored in the glass cabinets in the main room and assemble the tab

	    2. Using the label maker create a label using the study’s name, where the data was collected, the quarter (abbreviated) and year (abbreviated). Therefore, the format should follow something like this –
		```
		[study’s name] [location] – [quarter abbrev.] [year abbrev.]
		Ex. AA Foods Pilot Campus – SUM 08
		CS Rating Objects Lab – SP 08
		CS Male/Female Qday – WI 08
		```
	    3. Store the hanging folder in the appropriate drawer in the filing cabinet. Meaning, if the study was conducted in the spring of 2008 it should then go in the drawer labeled Spring 2008.

	- If a hanging folder has already been created…
		1. Use a manila folder to separate the different types of documents (ex. Consent forms should all be in one manila folder together, separate from the questionnaires)

		2. Label each manila folder using the label maker with an appropriate name (ex. Consent forms, questionnaires)

		3. Store the manila folder in the hanging folder for the appropriate study

Note: If the hanging folder starts to get overloaded, feel free to create a second hanging folder for that study by following the same format as above.
