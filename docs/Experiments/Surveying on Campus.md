When running subjects on campus, the most important thing to do is keep a **positive attitude**. You want people to be interested in your study and not discouraged from participating. Much of the procedure is similar to running subjects inside the lab, so similar rules will be applied to running subjects on campus.

Once again, it is very important to **follow instructions and scripts carefully** because you are working with human subjects, and the study must adhere to strict standards and guidelines in this process. Keep in mind that all scripts have been IRB approved and straying from them can be costly.


## Setting up the Study

- Materials you may need:
    - The script
    - Subject ID logsheet
    - Copies of the consent form (should be stamped)
    - Copies of the debriefing form
    - Copies of the questionnaire
    - Pens
    - Clipboard(s)

Make sure you have enough blank questionnaires for the time you are running subjects on campus.

Take out a blank questionnaire and write the subject number corresponding to the subject numbers on your logsheet in the upper right corners of your questionnaires. Also make sure you have all the required materials that you need for your study (e.g. a stopwatch if you are recording the time for the study).

## Before the Experiment

Approach a person that does not appear to be busy or intensely engaged in another activity. Depending on the study (e.g., one with conditions), approaching people that are alone might be preferable to approaching them in groups.  Make sure you understand your study to know who the target audience is for best results.  Follow the script exactly; we get it approved by the IRB so we are required to follow it precisely as it says.

Sample script (may vary depending on study):  

	Approach subject. 
	
	“Hi.  We are conducting a study for the UW Psychology Department.  We are asking students fill out a questionnaire that will take about [approximate time in minutes].  Are you interested?” 
	
	If no:  “Thank you for your time.”
	--------
	If yes:  Proceed with brief study description.
	
	“We want to learn more about…* [Brief statement].  *Here is a page that describes the study in more detail.”
	
	Hand over consent form.
	
	“Taking part in this study is voluntary. You can stop at any time.  Your responses are anonymous. Your responses are not linked to your name.”  
	“You may not directly benefit from taking part in this research study. We hope the results of this study will later benefit society. Do you have any questions? Do you want to complete the questionnaire?”
	
	If yes, have them sign consent form (if required) and hand them the questionnaire.

## During the Experiment

Fill out all fields on the **Subject ID logsheet** (i.e. your name, date, time).  Make sure the subject number matches the questionnaire number.  Keep an eye on your subject by occasionally glancing at their progress, making sure the information they are providing is not being affected by external variables (e.g. friends, phone calls, etc.).  If this does occur, please notify them to remain focused on their questionnaire and then make a note of the potential distraction on the logsheet.

## After the Experiment

After they are done, thank them and tell them what we are studying more precisely.

*Note*. Sometimes a debriefing sheet will be provided for the subject to read to learn more precisely on what the study was about.  In this case you would just hand the sheet to the participant and ask them to read it to learn more about the study.

If they have any further questions and you cannot answer the questions yourself, refer them to the study leader [name and email provided on the consent form].

## TIPS for Getting Subjects

- STAY POSITIVE! Happy faces will get people, not sad ones – make eye contact and smile before greeting them and asking them to participate.
- Go to locations where a lot of people can be found (e.g. the HUB, By George Café, the Quad, etc.). Food areas have tables which make it easier for the possible subjects to fill out the questionnaire.
- Having the script memorized. If your speech flows and you talk with enthusiasm, you are more likely to attract possible subjects into participating.

If you can, from permission of the study leader, offer the possible subjects an incentive to participating (e.g. a piece of candy).
