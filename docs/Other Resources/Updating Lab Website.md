## Navigating WordPress

To get to a certain page, click on “Pages” on the left sidebar to navigate there.

To start editing a certain page, find the page you would like to update, hover over it and several options will appear. Click “Open in Page Builder”.

Now that you have the page open, here are some things you might want to do:

## Adding text

The simplest way to add text is to hover over the upper right hand corner of the main page, and the option to “Open in WP Editor” will appear. Click on this.

A dialogue box will open, and you will be able to type in the text you want to appear on the website. Make sure you are on the “Visual” tab in the upper right corner.

If you find that you can’t get your text to look the way you want with the method above, there is another way to edit text. You can go to the “Styling” tab at the bottom of the page you want to edit, and manually change the settings to be more precise or match the text you would like to replicate.

When you’re ready to save your changes, click “Publish Changes” to make them live or “Save As Draft” to save your work, but not make it live.

## Adding a photo gallery

If you want to add photos to a page, you must first put the photos in a photo gallery. To add a photo gallery, click on “Galleries”, then “Add Gallery”.

You will be taken to a new page where you can add a new gallery.

Click on “Select Files” to add photos from the server.

Now that your photos are saved in a gallery, navigate to the “Photos” page (see: Adding text). There are many different elements you can add by dragging and dropping, but for the Photos page, we will only be using a few. Before you can add the photo gallery, there are a couple things you must add first.

First, drag and drop a separator just above the previous photo gallery. Make sure the grey outline appears when you hover over the area, and drop the separator below this line in the boxed area.

You can add text by dragging and dropping a text element just above the separator.

You will most likely have to use the alternative method of editing text (see bottom of page 4) to match the text to the rest of the page. You will also want to change the element width by hovering over the element and selecting the box icon. For example, if you want two elements to be side by side, change both of the widths to 6/12.

When the text is correct, you may add a “Gallery Slider” element

To choose a gallery to display in the gallery slider element, click on the drop down menu and choose the appropriate gallery.

## Adding a link to post

To add a link to a post, first make sure you are in the text editor (see adding text). Next, simply highlight the text you would like to link, and click the link button at the top of the page.

## Adding a photo to a post

Similarly to adding a link to a post, click on “Add Media” to add a photo.

## Updating current member photo

If you want to update a photo on the current members page, navigate to the partners tab on the left sidebar.

![[File Images Holder/Lab Website/wordpress_Partners.png]]
Hover over the person whose page you would like to edit, and click on “Edit”, which will take you to the “Edit Partner” page

![[File Images Holder/Lab Website/wordpress_editPartners.png]]
Once you are on the “Edit Partner” page,you can click on the current image to update it.

![[File Images Holder/Lab Website/wordpress_partnersImage.png]]
From here, you can upload a photo from the website or add a new one. Click “Set featured image” when you are done.

## Updating CVs (for grad students and PI)

Select “Pages” from the left side of the screen.

Next, navigate to the correct page – for grad students, the page will have their name and “linked URL” in the name (e.g. “Adriana Germano – linked URL”), for Sapna, it is simply titled “Sapna Cheryan” (NOTE: **Do not** update the “Sapna Cheryan – linked URL” page with an updated CV).

Then, hover over the “Info Box” element (see screenshot below) and select “Open in WP Editor”. Close out of the pop-up window and notice that a blue tab has appeared at the bottom of the screen (see screenshot). Paste the URL to the updated CV under the “Primary Button Link”.

Note: You can obtain the link to the CV by uploading the CV PDF to “Media” in Wordpress, then selecting the uploaded document in the Media Library.
